# RouterLessEE

A Node.js routing library. It's the Router Less Everything Else. With RouterLessEE, you don't have to load a large framework or library just to enable routing. This means you are not forced into any stack, such as MEAN just to enable routing. RouterLessEE has built in REST support as well.
